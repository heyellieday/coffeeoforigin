			<h4>Espacio Coworking Space offers freelancers and workers without an official office a chance to escape from the isolation of working-from-home. Espacio not only offers desk space for rent, but also a sense of community, as coworkers are able to ideate and collaborate with other like-minded people. It sure beats bouncing ideas off of your cat!
Espacio also strives to be a place for the Birmingham community at-large by offering a variety of learning opportunities, community events, and other enriching activities for all ages.  
Espacio formed in 2014 under the vision of Anamarie Sabbagh with the support of fellow coworking supporters In Birmingham and the surrounding communities.
